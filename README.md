# Alternative-Methods-to-Estimate-Body-Fat
Estimated human body fat percentage using linear models of common body measurements. We selected a final model by considering a combi-nation of: step-wise search methods, model stability plots, variable inclusion plots, and cross-validation errors. This was a group project as part of my DATA2902 (Data Analytics: Learning from Data) unit.

The project involved a presentation component as well as an executive summary component. The presentation slides are located in the slides.pdf file and our executive summary in the executive_summary.pdf file.
