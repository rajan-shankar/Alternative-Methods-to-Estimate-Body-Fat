# Alternative-Methods-to-Estimate-Body-Fat
Body fat percentage predictions using other body measurements. We analysed model stability plots and variable inclusion plots (Tarr et al., 2018) before selecting the final model via cross-validation. This was a group project as part of my DATA2902 (Data Analytics: Learning from Data) unit.
