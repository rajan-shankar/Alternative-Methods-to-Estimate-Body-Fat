# Alternative-Methods-to-Estimate-Body-Fat
Body fat percentage estimates using common body measurements. We analysed model stability plots and variable inclusion plots (Tarr et al., 2018) before selecting the final model via cross-validation. This was a group project as part of my DATA2902 (Data Analytics: Learning from Data) unit.

The project involved a presentation component as well as an executive summary component. The slides used in our presentation are located in the slides.pdf file, and our executive summary in the executive_summary.pdf file.
